HookedTransformer comes loaded with >40 open source GPT-style models. You can load any of them in with `HookedTransformer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)`. See my explainer for documentation of all supported models, and this table for hyper-parameters and the name used to load them. Each model is loaded into the consistent HookedTransformer architecture, designed to be clean, consistent and interpretability-friendly. 

For this demo notebook we'll look at GPT-2 Small, an 80M parameter model. To try the model the model out, let's find the loss on this paragraph!"""
