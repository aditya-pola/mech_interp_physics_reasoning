# Cloud GPU Options for Running PaliGemma-3B

## Free/Low-Cost Options:

### 1. Google Colab (Free tier)
- Free GPU (T4) for limited time
- ~15GB VRAM available
- Perfect for this model size
- Code:
```python
!pip install transformers peft accelerate
# Upload your code and run
```

### 2. Kaggle Kernels (Free)
- 30 hours/week of GPU (P100)
- 16GB VRAM
- Good for experiments

### 3. Paperspace Gradient (Free tier)
- Free GPUs available
- Good for testing

## Paid Options (Still Affordable):

### 1. Google Colab Pro ($10/month)
- Better GPUs (V100/A100)
- Longer runtime
- Priority access

### 2. Vast.ai (~$0.20-0.50/hour)
- Rent GPUs from individuals
- Very cost-effective
- Choose RTX 3090/4090 for best value

### 3. Lambda Labs (~$0.50/hour)
- Professional cloud GPUs
- A10/A100 available

### 4. RunPod.io (~$0.30/hour)
- Similar to Vast.ai
- Good selection of GPUs

## Quick Setup for Google Colab:

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. Create new notebook
3. Change runtime to GPU (Runtime -> Change runtime type -> GPU)
4. Mount Google Drive:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
5. Clone your repo or upload files
6. Install dependencies and run

## For Your Local System:

Since you don't have a CUDA GPU, you have these options:

1. **Use CPU mode** (very slow):
   - Use the eval_cpu.py script I created
   - Expect 5-10 minutes per sample
   - Only practical for testing with few samples

2. **Use quantization** (still slow but better):
   ```python
   from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig
   quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)
   model = PaliGemmaForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
       model_id,
       quantization_config=quantization_config,
       device_map="cpu"
   )
   ```

3. **Use smaller model** for testing:
   - Try a smaller vision-language model like BLIP-2 base
   - Or use a tiny test dataset

## Recommendation:
For actual evaluation, use Google Colab (free) or rent a GPU for ~$1-2 to run your full evaluation. Your local system can be used for:
- Code development
- Data preparation
- Results analysis
- Small-scale testing (1-2 samples)
